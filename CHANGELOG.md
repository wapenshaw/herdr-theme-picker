# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions follow semver and
match the `version` field in `herdr-plugin.toml`.

## [0.10.0] — Unreleased

- **No background daemon.** Removed the 0.9 startup hook and sync loop that
  recolored every Herdr terminal on the server machine, including clients with
  their own colors. Terminal colors now change only on apply or explicit
  `sync`, like the Bash version. The old `startup` command is a no-op.
- **Client-machine model.** Applying writes the config of the machine running
  the picker and recolors only Herdr clients on that machine (including
  `herdr --remote` clients started there; never the remote bridge). When only
  `--remote` clients are attached, `prefix+t` shows instructions to run the
  picker on the client's own machine. A failed reload is a warning that points
  to `prefix+shift+r`.
- **Config fixes.** `[theme.custom.light]` / `[theme.custom.dark]` are kept;
  repeated applies no longer add blank lines; a missing config is created;
  lookup order matches Herdr (`HERDR_CONFIG_PATH`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, platform).
- **Compatibility.** Recognize `herdr session attach <name>` clients; reuse
  Bash-era download caches offline; keep old Unix theme names and preserve
  unsupported index entries; skip broken user themes instead of failing.
- Tests run in an isolated temporary home/config/state with a fake `herdr`.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-09-01

- **Precise pane borders.** The preview's box-drawing rules no longer get
  ragged: `_padr` was padding by *bytes* (`printf %-*. Ns`), so rows containing
  `─ │ ○ ✓` came out 2 columns short at any font size. Padding now counts
  characters; the UTF-8 locale is forced when the inherited one is byte-based.
- **Closed inactive-pane box.** The dim pane is now a full rectangle with a
  gray (`overlay0`) border matching the accent border of the focused pane.
- **Sidebar spaces renamed** `AGENT/LINUX → space1/space2`, each showing its
  `main` workspace — no theme-specific workspace names in the mock.
- **Gray footer text.** `new/menu/agents/priority` now render in `overlay0`
  (they were one notch too bright at `subtext0`).
- **Selected agent row.** The AGENT panel shows a highlighted agent (accent
  name on `active_row_bg`) beside a dim unselected one; legend adds
  `overlay0`/`surface_dim` rows and no longer truncates token names.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-31

- **Workspace-faithful theme preview.** The fzf preview pane now renders a mock
  of a real Herdr workspace in the candidate theme's colors: focused pane with
  its full accent border, active vs inactive tabs, spaces sidebar (selected
  workspace row, `new/menu`, `agents/priority` footer), powerline prompt,
  a text-selection run, and the AGENT panel with a state dot and agent name.
  The preview now answers "what will my workspace look like with this theme
  applied" instead of showing an abstract swatch.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-30

- **Live terminal color sync** (contributed by @neospeed83 in #2). `apply.sh`
  now emits OSC 4/10/11 sequences to the terminal emulator hosting Herdr,
  updating the 16 ANSI palette colors instantly on every theme pick — no
  terminal restart required. Works with any emulator that supports OSC color
  setting (Ghostty, iTerm2, WezTerm, Alacritty, …). The plugin locates the
  outer PTY slave via `ps` because Herdr's multiplexer intercepts
  `/dev/tty` writes.
- **Optional Ghostty new-window persistence.** When `~/.config/ghostty/herdr-theme`
  exists and is `config-file`d from your Ghostty config, the plugin mirrors
  every picked palette there so new Ghostty windows open with the same theme.
- **README fix.** Herdr 0.8.2 does not bind keys declared in a plugin's
  manifest `[[keys.command]]` block. README now instructs users to add the
  `prefix+t` block to their `config.toml` manually (Install, Uninstall,
  Change the keybind, Manifest sections updated).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-21

- **Legend in the preview.** The preview pane now shows which Herdr token each
  palette line drives (`accent ← palette 4`, `red ← palette 1`, …) with a color
  chip, so it's clear why a scheme's dominant color isn't necessarily the
  selector. Documents that `palette 10–15` are unused by the mapping.
- **Edit a custom theme (`ctrl-e`).** Built-in fzf token editor (no external
  editor): pick a Herdr token, type a new hex, and the preview rebuilds live to
  show what changes. `✓ Save & apply` commits; `esc` discards. Edits persist as
  per-theme `# hpick-override:` lines layered over the derived mapping.
- **Delete a custom theme (`ctrl-d`).** Confirm `y`/`N`; only ★ user themes can
  be deleted — bundled themes are refused.
- `map.sh` gains `apply_overrides` + token origin/role metadata; new
  `bin/edit.sh`, `bin/delete.sh`, `lib.sh:is_user_theme`; new
  `tests/test_edit.sh`, `tests/test_delete.sh`, override cases in
  `tests/test_map.sh`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-21

- **Editor prefers nvim.** The `+ Add new theme…` flow now opens **nvim** when
  it's installed (falling back to `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`, then `nano`/`vi`), so
  pasting/editing a palette is comfortable instead of dropping into raw `vi`.
- **`+ Add from clipboard…` row.** A second add row skips the editor entirely:
  reads a ghostty-format palette from the system clipboard
  (`pbpaste`/`wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel`), prompts only for a name, then saves,
  indexes, and applies. Copy → open picker → pick → name → done.
- Refactored `add.sh` around a shared `_finalize` (validate → name → save →
  index) with editor and clipboard entry points; prompts are testable via
  `TTY_IN`. Added `_finalize`/`pick_editor` self-checks to `test_add.sh`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-19

- **Add themes from inside the picker.** A `+ Add new theme…` row is pinned at
  the bottom; press **Tab** (from anywhere) or **Enter** on that row to open
  your `$EDITOR` with a ghostty-format template. Paste a palette, save, name
  it, and it's validated, saved, appended to the list, and applied.
- User-added themes live in `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR/themes` + `index.txt`, so
  plugin updates never overwrite them; they show in the list marked `★`.
- `apply.sh` now fails safely (config untouched) on an unresolved or invalid
  palette instead of writing an empty block.
- All user-facing strings are English.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-19

- **Fix:** reopening the picker no longer hides the other themes. The applied
  theme is floated to the top with `✓` instead of being used as a search
  query, so the full list stays browsable.
- Search field moved to the **top** (`--layout=reverse`) with a clear
  `Search themes:` prompt and a "type to search" hint, so it's obvious you
  can type to filter.
- Preview redesigned into a fuller Herdr layout mock: left `spaces` sidebar
  (space header, cpu·ram, now-playing, second space), a two-pane workspace
  with the active pane highlighted vs. a dim inactive pane, tab bar
  (`WORKSPACE`/`Files`), and a bottom agent pane with state dots.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-19

- Preview now mocks the actual Herdr UI in the theme's colors — workspace
  header, agent panes (working/done/blocked/idle state colors), active/inactive
  tab bar, and pane body — instead of a bare color list.
- All picker UI text is English; compact layout with an inline header hint.
- Popup closes automatically after applying (no keypress needed).
- Applied theme is remembered (`HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR/applied`), marked with
  `✓`, and the cursor lands on it when the picker reopens.
